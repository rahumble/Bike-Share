# Bike-Share
Code and report associated with a Kaggle challenge called Bike Sharing Demand. The purpose of this project was to best predict bike share ridership given weather information and historical ridership.

The main R file is final.R. That file calls all the other files in order.

The challenge and the datasets can be retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand.

The output is results.csv, which has to be uploaded to Kaggle to determine the accuracy of the predictions.
